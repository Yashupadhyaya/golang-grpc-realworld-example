FUNCTION_DEF=func (s *UserStore) GetByUsername(username string) (*model.User, error) // GetByUsername finds a user from username

Based on the provided function and context, here are several test scenarios for the `GetByUsername` method of the `UserStore` struct:

```
Scenario 1: Successfully retrieve a user by username

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function can successfully retrieve a user from the database when given a valid username.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with a pre-existing user record.
  Act: Call GetByUsername with a known username.
  Assert: Verify that the returned user matches the expected user data and that no error is returned.
Validation:
  This test ensures the basic functionality of the method works as expected under normal conditions. It's crucial for verifying that user lookups, which are likely a common operation, function correctly.

Scenario 2: Attempt to retrieve a non-existent user

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the function when querying for a username that doesn't exist in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with no matching user for the target username.
  Act: Call GetByUsername with a non-existent username.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a nil user and a "record not found" error.
Validation:
  This test is important for error handling, ensuring that the function behaves correctly when no matching user is found, which is a common edge case in user lookups.

Scenario 3: Database connection error

Details:
  Description: This test simulates a database connection error to verify the function's error handling capabilities.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database that returns a connection error when queried.
  Act: Call GetByUsername with any username.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a nil user and the database connection error.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's ability to handle and propagate database errors, which is crucial for robust error management in the application.

Scenario 4: Multiple users with the same username (data integrity test)

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior when multiple users with the same username exist in the database (which shouldn't happen but could occur due to data integrity issues).
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with multiple user records having the same username.
  Act: Call GetByUsername with the duplicated username.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the first matching user without error.
Validation:
  While this scenario shouldn't occur in a properly maintained database due to the unique constraint on the username, testing it ensures the function behaves predictably even in unexpected data scenarios.

Scenario 5: Case sensitivity in username lookup

Details:
  Description: This test verifies whether the username lookup is case-sensitive or case-insensitive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with a user with a mixed-case username.
  Act: Call GetByUsername with the same username but in a different case (e.g., all lowercase).
  Assert: Verify whether the function returns the user (case-insensitive) or returns nil with an error (case-sensitive).
Validation:
  This test is important for understanding and documenting the case sensitivity behavior of the username lookup, which can affect how users interact with the system.

Scenario 6: Performance with a large dataset

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's performance when querying a large dataset.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with a large number of user records (e.g., 100,000+).
  Act: Call GetByUsername with a username that exists in the database.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct user within an acceptable time frame.
Validation:
  While not a functional test, this scenario is crucial for ensuring the method performs well under load, which is important for the application's scalability.
```

These scenarios cover a range of normal operations, edge cases, and error handling situations for the `GetByUsername` function. They take into account the function's interaction with the database, potential data integrity issues, and performance considerations.
